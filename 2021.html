            <p><i>[2021-12-08]</i> <a href="https://www.nrk.no/norge/regjeringen-holder-pressekonferanse-om-koronasituasjonen-1.15761782">New restrictions</a> were
            announced by the government yesterday due to increasing spread of the new and
            very contagious Omicron variant.</p>
            <p>Although it's technically possible to go ahead with
                the event, the trend is not looking that great, and we wouldn't
                want to expose you or anyone else to additional health risks.</p>
            <p>So unfortunately, we have decided to cancel the rC3@hackeriet event. :-(</p>
            <p>The online CCC event <a href="https://events.ccc.de/#rc3-2021-nowhere-en-version">[rC3 2021 - NOWHERE]</a> is of course still happening.</p>
            <p>And you're always welcome to come chat with us on <a href="ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/#oslohackerspace">#oslohackerspace</a> :D</p>
